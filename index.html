            <h2>Introducing social economy in Rwanda Ubudehe category</h2>
            <div class="line-dec"></div>
            <span>Ubudehe refers to the long-standing Rwandan cultural practice of collective action and mutual support to solve with problem within the community (src: Rwandapedia). As a developing country, Rwanda has a vision of fighting against poverty and improving the welfare of its population. One way the Rwandan government has sought to improve the welfare of its people is by classifying households into categories based on individual living standards and economy. 
            Ubudehe categories are revised every three years, and cover more than 2.7 million households.</span>

                  <h4>In 2001 is where start using categories</h4>
                  <p>In 2001, the government reintroduced Ubudehe as a process whereby people from the same cell come together to evaluate their current living situations, and decide on solutions to improving development. In this process, the heads of households from the same cell come together and classify themselves into six different socio-economic categories, ranging from the poorest households (Category 1) to the richest households (Category 6). </p>

                  <h4>In 2015 changes happen</h4>
                  <p>And in February 2015 Minister for local government and social affair launched new categories 
                     for ubudehe because many Rwandan households economic situations had risen dramatically, requiring 
                     a recategorisation, and also previous categorization system many households resisted being properly
                     classified due to the derogatory names attached to the different levels, distorting the categorization process. 
                     The new categories are from 1(Very poor) to 4(Richest).  </p>

                  <h4>In 2020 gornment reclassify categorie which currrently used</h4>
                  <p>In 2020 government re-classify household according to their socioeconomic status.
                     A common complaint was that households with different welfare levels were classified in 
                     the same category; another was that households in category 1 and 2 had almost the same standards 
                     of living. The new model seeks to be cost-effective, evenly spreads resources, and assigns roles 
                     and tasks across all categories. Category names have also been changed from numerical number to 
                     letters from A (rich one) to E (family has some problem prevent them from working like physical disability).</p>
